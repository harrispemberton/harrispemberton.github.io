			<p>In the National Football League, teams are always rushing to gain an advantage. Over the past decade, they’ve turned to advanced numbers to do so. Sports analytics have revolutionized modern athletics, giving teams answers on performance, on-field decisions or identifying issues to address. The industry has boomed over the past decade, and is expected to grow 21.5% by 2030, per the <a href="https://gis.sport/news/the-rise-of-sports-analytics" target="_blank">Global Institute of Sport</a>.</p>

<p>Engineered in 2007, sports analytics website <a href="pff.com" target="_blank"> Pro Football Focus (PFF)</a> is a pioneer in helping fans understand trends across the NFL and how they correlate to winning. Based on deep analysis of team grades and performance over the 2024 season and the first 13 weeks of the 2025, PFF’s data indicates the importance of the passing game, the sparse impact of special teams, and suggests teams like the Kansas City Chiefs are underperforming, while teams like the Carolina Panthers are overperforming.</p>

<p>But how is this data found — or used?</p>

<p>PFF analyzes NFL and Division I College Football, employing over 600 analysts. PFF produces advanced statistics and a 0-100 grade for each team and player in every game.</p> 

<p>PFF’s system grades a player’s “contribution to production” on a given play. Each player is given a grade from -2 to +2, with 0 being the “average” grade. Then, the plus-minus grades are converted to a 100-point scale.</p> 

<p>“A positive play is going to be closer to that +2 side, and a negative play is going to be closer to that minus -2 side,” PFF NFL Contributor <a href="https://www.pff.com/analyst/dalton-wasserman" target="_blank"> Dalton Wasserman</a> said. “Then, there's a formula behind the scenes which spits out the final number for the entirety of the game, whether it be for a player or team or a certain unit.”</p>

<p>The grades are just one part of PFF’s work, though. They calculate advanced statistics and data used by all 32 NFL squads and several college teams, Wasserman said.</p> 

<p>Most teams, like the New York Giants, rely on data to educate decisions of the coaching staff. In an <a href="https://www.giants.com/video/dir-of-football-data-innovation-ty-siam-on-giants-use-of-analytics" target="_blank">interview on the Giants' website</a>, Director of Football Data and Innovation Ty Siam discussed how the Giants use complex models to understand the tendencies of opponents and themselves, aimed at helping make decisions on the fly each game week.</p> 

<p>“Every week, we’re keeping a pulse on what the opponent is going to find about us,” Siam said. “If we have a tendency, we want to know where it is and how we can adjust before they exploit it.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes there are individual moments where something we produced helped decide a game, but sometimes it’s the things that didn’t happen because data supported a different decision,” he added.</p> 

<p>Of course, the numbers won’t always be an exact reflection of whether teams will win. Like all sports, football involves playing situationally. It's impossible to account for injuries or chaos. Even then, not all teams that do things right are rewarded with wins. But, the data helps fans and coaches understand what their teams are doing right and how it correlates to winning.</p> 

<p>So, which factors really matter most?</p>

			<h3>Air it out</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<p>The NFL has shifted to a pass-first league over the past several decades. PFF shows that the teams who do it best tend to win the most: passing grade is the stat that most directly correlates with wins.</p> 

<p>“It just comes down to the basics of football,” Wasserman said. “If your quarterback is really good, your team should be really good.” </p>

<p>In 2024, teams with a top-16 passing grade averaged 4.6875 more wins (41.67% more) than teams with a bottom-16 passing grade. Six of the teams with a top-8 passing grade made the playoffs last season. Only one team with a 75 or higher passing grade won less than eight games. </p>

<p>Through Dec. 1, 2025, teams with a top-16 passing grade averaged 2.5625 more wins (35.04% more) than teams with a bottom-half passing grade. Among the teams with a top-5 passing grade this season are the Los Angeles Rams (nine wins), Green Bay Packers (eight wins), New England Patriots (11 wins) and Philadelphia Eagles (eight wins), all teams expected to make the playoffs.</p> 

<p>“(Football’s) a team game, and those other factors can play a part, but absolutely, if you've got a strong quarterback, you're likely going to have a pretty strong team,” Wasserman said.

			<h3>Not-so-special teams</h3>
			<p>Of PFF’s overall grades, special teams, which includes kicking, punting, returns and return defense, have little correlation with winning.</p> 

<p>In 2024, teams with a top-16 special teams grade averaged just 1.8125 more wins (18.47% more) than teams with a bottom-16 special teams grade. Through Dec. 1 in 2025, teams with a top-16 special teams grade averaged a measly 0.1875 more wins (3.06% more) than teams with a bottom-half special teams grade.</p> 

<p>In 2024, three of the league’s top-5 special teams units had four or less wins (New England Patriots, Cleveland Browns and Jacksonville Jaguars.) In 2025, all three of those teams have had worse special teams units, yet have actually won more games.</p> 

<p>This season, three of the league’s top-5 units have also won less than four games (Minnesota Vikings, Washington Commanders, New York Jets.)</p>

<p>“(Special teams are) still very important, it's just that there are less special teams plays compared to offense and defense,” Wasserman said. “It’s naturally going to have less of an overall effect.”</p>

<p>Special teams can undoubtedly help a team win games, but, as PFF’s data suggests, it's not a factor that can be relied on to win a team games.</p> 

<p>“Sometimes (special teams) don't correlate as strongly to the team records, but it’s still very important when it comes to the individual outcome of some of these games,” Wasserman said.</p>

			<h3>Who is under/overperforming?</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<p>Of course, PFF’s overall team grades don’t necessarily correlate to success. But if they did, several teams’ seasons would be looking quite different.</p> 

<p>Based on 2025 overall grades, the Detroit Lions (92.6 overall grade), Kansas City Chiefs (85.3) and Houston Texans (83.2) are playing well but still losing frequently. All three have a top-8 overall grade but have just seven, six and seven wins, respectively. The Carolina Panthers (70.5, seven wins) and Miami Dolphins (69, five wins) have low overall grades but are still winning more consistently than their grades would suggest.</p> 

<p>Wasserman pointed to the Nov. 30 game between the Panthers and Rams an outlier that shows the unpredictability of the NFL. The Rams graded higher on both sides of the ball, but turnovers allowed the Panthers to steal a narrow win.</p>

<p>“For as much information as we can have and as strongly as it can correlate, every game is its own set of events, and there can be some randomness that could really change the outcome,” Wasserman said.</p>

			<h3>Final takeaways</h3>
			<p>PFF’s data can't tell the whole story. NFL football will always be filled with the unexpected. But the analysis implies several key trends about passing and special teams that are digestible for fans. As analytics continue to sweep front offices, they’re also changing the game for fans, helping them understand what winning football looks like. And as long as PFF does so, the game will continue to be revolutionized by data.
